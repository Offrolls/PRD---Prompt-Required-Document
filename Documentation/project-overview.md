# Project Overview

### 1. Vision Statement

To create an extraordinarily delightful, fast, and collaborative hiring platform that empowers independent recruiters and agencies to scale their placement business and accelerates the hiring process. We aim to be the go-to solution for collaborative hiring.

### 2. Problem Statement

The current technology stack (PHP CodeIgniter, HTML, and CSS) is creating significant challenges for both our team and end-users. These issues include:

* **Slow Performance:** Pages are slow to load, and every user action, no matter how small, requires a full page refresh, leading to a frustrating user experience.

* **High Maintenance & Development Time:** The existing codebase is difficult to maintain and scale. This makes it challenging and time-consuming to fix bugs and build new features.

* **Limited Innovation:** The outdated stack makes it nearly impossible to introduce modern features and advanced functionality, such as AI, that are critical for competing in the market.

### 3. Solution

We will redesign and rebuild key parts of our application on a modern, scalable technology stack. This will allow us to:

* **Drastically Improve User Experience:** Eliminate slow page loads and constant refreshes by creating a fast, seamless, and dynamic interface.

* **Enhance Collaboration:** Streamline existing workflows and add new collaborative features that make it easier for employers and talent partners to work together.

* **Accelerate Innovation:** Enable our team to iterate faster and build new features more efficiently, including AI-powered tools.

* **Empower Recruiters:** Provide independent recruiters and agencies with powerful, intuitive tools to manage their needs to find the right candidates.

### 4. Goals & Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Our main goal for this project is to increase the speed of both iteration and the overall product. We will measure success by the following goals and KPIs:

* **Goal 1: Achieve Feature Parity**
    * **KPI:** All core features from the existing product are successfully migrated and launched in the new system.
    * **KPI:** All current workflows are fully functional and pass all regression tests.

* **Goal 2: Increase Development Velocity**
    * **KPI:** Reduce the average time to build and deploy a new feature by at least 50% compared to the old technology stack.
    * **KPI:** The team is able to release new features and updates on a more frequent basis.

* **Goal 3: Enhance Product Speed & Delight**
    * **KPI:** Decrease the average page load time for the redesigned screens by over 75%.
    * **KPI:** The new user experience is intuitive, and all actions are seamless, leading to high user satisfaction.
